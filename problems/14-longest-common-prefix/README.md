# [Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
**Output:** "fl"
```
**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
**Output:** ""
**Explanation:** There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
* `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
* `strs[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.
