# [Longest Balanced Substring I](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-balanced-substring-i/)

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.

A **substring** of `s` is called **balanced** if all **distinct** characters in the **substring** appear the **same** number of times.

Return the **length** of the **longest balanced substring** of `s`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abbac"

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The longest balanced substring is `"abba"` because both distinct characters `'a'` and `'b'` each appear exactly 2 times.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "zzabccy"

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The longest balanced substring is `"zabc"` because the distinct characters `'z'`, `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'` each appear exactly 1 time.​​​​​​​

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "aba"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

**​​​​​​​**One of the longest balanced substrings is `"ab"` because both distinct characters `'a'` and `'b'` each appear exactly 1 time. Another longest balanced substring is `"ba"`.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
